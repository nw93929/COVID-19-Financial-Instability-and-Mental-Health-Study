# Study Context
# I. Data Collection
The data was sourced from the National Wellbeing Survey (NWS) 2022, conducted by Syracuse University. This annual cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults (ages 18–64) includes questions on mental well-being, social relations, physical health, and socioeconomic factors. Our analysis uses the public version of the data, which excludes geographic details. The dataset, with a sample size of 7,644 respondents, applies post-stratification weights to ensure national representativeness, despite being collected through a voluntary, non-probability sampling method. The NWS uses Qualtrics, an online survey platform that is known to employ quality control measures to maintain consistency within data. Some of these measures include screening to prevent duplicate entries, respondent validation, and following up with nonresponses to reduce the number of missing entries. However, since the survey is a non-probability, voluntary format, there is a risk of selection bias, which limits the generalizability of the results of the study.
The study is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and Syracuse University’s Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion and Population Health. The involvement of reputable institutions and regulatory agencies highlights the reliability of the data source. Also, the data uses validated measures like the Satisfaction with Life Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4), ensuring data reliability.
# II. Research Questions
### Key Questions to Address 
Our research investigates the impact of COVID-related financial instability on individual subjective well-being, with a focus on identifying specific types of financial debt that may disproportionately affect mental health. Various categories of debt are analyzed to determine if any particular type has a stronger association with mental health outcomes. Additionally, socioeconomic factors—including demographic and physical health indicators—are incorporated to further stratify and examine the correlation between financial instability and subjective well-being. This approach provides a detailed understanding of how financial challenges related to COVID-19 may influence mental health across different population groups.

# II. B. Variable Selection 
### Context of Questions
According to past studies, financial difficulties have a strong impact on people’s mental health status, especially during economic downturns (Ng et al., 2013). Studies have shown that economic crises are associated with increases in unhealthy coping strategies, such as substance use, and elevated suicide rates (Ng et al., 2013). However, evidence also highlights that proactive coping policies, such as those implemented in Sweden and Finland, have effectively reduced suicide rates despite economic hardship (Recession 'link' with over 10,000 suicides in the west: University 2014). With the deteriorating financial situations and cumulative unhealthy behaviors, it is beneficial to understand the correlation between debt stimuli and subjective well-being to inform protective strategies aimed at the most vulnerable economic sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic, as the most recent public health and economic crisis, offers a timely context for examining how pandemic-related financial instability has influenced mental health, providing deeper insights into the current population’s well-being.
Multiple studies have already concluded a positive correlation between financial difficulties and major depression (Ng et al., 2013). However, debt itself has rarely been a primary focus in mental health studies. Perspectives on debt’s psychological impact are varied: some researchers suggest debt exerts a direct negative effect on mental health, as owing money can undermine one’s sense of control and coping ability, leading to poorer psychological outcomes; others speculate that debt may act as a buffer and decrease stress because debt acts as a safe net to help cope with financial hardship (Drentea & Reynolds, 2014). Additionally, some studies propose that subjective financial stress has a more profound impact on mental health than objective financial indebtedness. Despite these perspectives, the research remains limited, with existing studies often treating debt as a binary variable rather than differentiating by debt type (Drentea & Reynolds, 2014). Thus, by directly addressing the mental health problem in the context of various forms of financial debt, this study aims to clarify whether different types of debt have distinct negative or mitigating effects on subjective well-being.
Many studies on economic hardship and mental health suggest that certain subgroups strongly correlate financial stress and psychological well-being (Aneshensel, 1992). Various demographic and physical health factors—such as age, gender, ethnicity, general health, income, unemployment status, residential areas, education, race, marital status, sleep hours, and military status—are shown to influence this relationship. Therefore, those listed variables are controls in our study (Dressler, 1988; de Miquel et al., 2022; Aneshensel, 1992; Hafner et al., 2017; Moulden, 2023).

Those observations closely align with the social stress theory (Aneshensel, 1992), which posits that disadvantaged groups are more vulnerable to stress because they have fewer coping strategies. Consequently, socioeconomic factors significantly shape the relationship between financial hardship and psychological well-being. Overgeneralizing the results of different vulnerabilities into a single result causes problems because the effects are not specific to each subgroup. Stratifying this relationship across different subgroups enables the identification of vulnerable populations, thus allowing for targeted mental health interventions. By narrowing down the high-risk groups, both healthcare professionals and policymakers can develop focused and preventative strategies aimed at those most susceptible to financial stress-related mental health issues (Long-term physical conditions and mental health, 2022).
